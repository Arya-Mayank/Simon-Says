Simon Says is a web app I made using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
Its a game the highlights a coloured square and waits for you to repeat the pattern by clicking it.
As the game progresses, you have to remember all the squares that were randomly highlighted by the game and click them in same order to continue to the next level.
